# My Process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - PokeAPI's RESTful API

### What I learned

  Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into working with RESTful APIs and manipulating their data effectively. Some key takeaways include:

  API Data Manipulation: I learned how to efficiently retrieve data and leveraging various endpoints from the PokeAPI using RESTful API calls.

  Random Pokémon Generation: Through the API, I learned the process of generating random Pokémon by utilizing the available data. This allowed me to create an engaging experience for users, providing them with a unique encounter each time they interacted with the game.

  DOM Manipulation with Query Selectors: Implementing the retrieved data into the game interface was made possible by leveraging JavaScript's query selectors. I could dynamically display the Pokémon's name and other relevant information on the webpage, enhancing the user experience.


### Continued development

Diving into this project marked my debut in the world of RESTful APIs, and let me tell you, it was a blast! Getting hands-on with the PokeAPI data was like uncovering buried treasure — I had a blast manipulating it and creating an interactive front end for users to enjoy. Seeing it all come together, presenting information in a way that's both snazzy and user-friendly, got my creative gears turning. 

This project stirred up a real interest in me for RESTful APIs. I mean, the power to tap into this ocean of data and shape it into cool apps is something I definitely want to dive deeper into.
